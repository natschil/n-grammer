ngram.analysis

	The ngram.analysis program contains various functions for analysing the output
	from the ngram.counting program.
	
	It has the following syntax:
	
	ngram.analysis processing_folder COMMAND OPTIONS
	
		where COMMAND is one of:
				invert_index
				search
				get_top
				make_wordlength_stats
				view_wordlength_stats

invert_index
	invert_index is used for creating an index sorted by descending frequency
	on the n-gram index specified by the first option.

	For example, to create an index sorted by frequency on the 4-gram index where
	the words are ordered as they were in the text, run invert_index 0_1_2_3

	As another example, to create an index sorted by frequency on the 3-gram index
	that has the word order so that the third word is first, then the first and then
	the second word, run invert_index 2_0_1 .

	invert_index has a complexity of O(N), where N is the size of the n-gram  index
	to be created.

get_top
	get_top is the counterpart to invert_index. It displays the top m words of the 
	inverted index specified, where m is the second argument to invert_index. The first
	argument to invert_index is the the n-gram number. Currently get_top only supports
	outputting from indexes like 0 or 0_1 or 0_1_2 or 0_1_2_3 etc..

	For example, to get the 10 most frequent 2-grams, run get_top 2 10
	after having run invert_index 0_1

	get_top has a complexity of O(1).

search
	search is used for searching for n-grams. It takes a single option as an argument
	which is the search string. 

	For example run ./search "this is * test"  to search for all 4-grams where the first
	word is "this", the second word is "is" and the last word is "test". The search would
	find 4-grams like "this is a test" or "this is the test".

	search has a worst case complexity of O(log(N)), where N is the size of the n-gram index.

make_wordlength_stats
	This function goes through the file by_0_1_2_ ..._n and creates a table of n-gram length.
	The single argument for this function is the relevant value of n.
	(in utf8 code-points) to frequency of n-grams that n-gram length occuring in the corpus.
	The complexity of this function is O(1). Note that MAX_WORD_SIZE in make_wordlength_stats
	must correspond to the approriate value in config.h of the n-gram counter. If this is not the
	case then what happens when calling make_wordlength_stats is undefined.

view_wordlength_stats
	This function shows the table generated by make_wordlength_stats. The argument is the number of
	words (i.e. the n) for which the table should be shown. make_wordlength_stats needs to be called
	before calling view_wordlength_stats.
